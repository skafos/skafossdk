Model Versions
==============
A model version is a particular instance of a model. It refers to a machine learning model
artifact that was uploaded to Skafos and will be delivered to your iOS application. Skafos auto-versions your
machine learning models when you upload them to the platform.

.. note:: Do not get confused! A model version refers to a specific instance of a model (with the same :attr:`model_name`).

Each model version has a generated :attr:`version` number that you should use to identify it.
