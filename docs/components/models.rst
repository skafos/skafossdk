Models
======
Models are the second integration point between Skafos and your iOS application. An organization owns
an app, and within an app, you can have one or more models. On Skafos, models are a bin for you to upload
different versions of your trained machine learning model as they evolve over time.

Each model has a :attr:`model_name` that you should use to identify it.
