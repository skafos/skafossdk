Organizations
=============
While working with Skafos.ai, your user account by default is linked to a personal organization. Think
of an organization like a team. It can have one or more persons. You can join or leave organizations similarly
to GitHub. As a member of an organization, you have access to all Apps and Models owned by that org.

Each organization has an :attr:`org_name` that you should use to identify it.
